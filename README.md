# Hackathon_Project
# Report: Analysis of Late Delivery Causes using 2-Way ANOVA
# Objective
To identify the factors contributing to late delivery of orders in the Northwind database by analyzing the impact of two categorical variables: 'Shipping Company' and 'Ship City' on 'Delivery Time'.

# Data
Orders Table: Contains details about orders including delivery times, shipping methods, and regions.
# Variables
Dependent Variable: Delivery Time (difference between required date and shipped date)
Independent Variables:
Shipping Method (e.g., 'Speedy Express', 'United Package', 'Federal Shipping')
Order Region (e.g., 'North America', 'Europe', 'Asia')
Methodology
Extract relevant data from the Northwind database.
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
Conduct a 2-Way ANOVA to determine the main effects of 'Shipping Method' and 'Order Region', and their interaction effect on 'Delivery Time'.
